tendency for other scholars in other disciplines to disregard methodologies from anthroplogy: magda mentioned this and said that there is a kind of appropriation process. 

turf-claiming is in this neoliberal academic moment. everything is compared with the scientific, output-driven research, whereas anthropology can't do this, and even theatre and performance studies cant do it either. 

anthropology has become really textual. trend in new materialisms. itts become really in the head, and a criticism is that its been an appropriation of philosophy. 

magda is not saying that interdisciplinarity does not have its merits, but that its very complicated. 

Jackie pointed out that in academia, there isn't only one audience to read (read outside the academy)

clifford: writing culture -- debate on how we use and interpret text, literary focus

gave an image analysis of the book covers [i missed the first one on clifford, but the conquergood was interesting]:
	- conquergood has a facade of a building, and [name of presenter in class] said that when you try to look at something objectively you only see its exterior (possibly she used a different word), and that theatre can help go inside the [object?]


references de certeau
	- points out that that prevailing view was that literature is anything that is not science
	- clifford asks who has the authority to separate science from art?

clifford:
	critique of colonialism
	limits of representation
	science of language itself
		- semiotics and discourse analysis
			- there are a lot of limits on the ways that we discuss a subject
	critique of "visualism"
		- walter j ong: "looking at, objectifying, or reading a given reality" (11)

	clifford was aware of the fetishization of text itself
		- ethnography is a hybrid textual activity


>>>> this might be good to look at in terms of a possible comparison between text-based code and patch-based code. 
conquergood:

	textualism
		distance
		detachment
		disclosure
		containment/inscription/abstraction/closure (ricouer)

	performance
		immediace
		involvement 
		intimacy
		non-verbal dimension and embodied dynamics



clifford geertz: world as text model <<< posibly useful for the github 'world'
	- 'the culture of a 

	but to imagine that you can read everything is mistaken because '


	ricoeur: the model of the text: "meaningful action is a model for science..." (clifford 55)

	de certeau: set forth a performatibe theory of everdal life that celebrates the restless energies and subversive powers of knesis, 'this challenging mobility that oes not respect places' (de certeau in conquergood 55)


	clifford says culture is a kind of intervention

embodiment

"the whole point of embodiment is that no one will ever experience your body like you" (again I don't yet know the name of the person presenting)

madison
	- positionality and responsibility
	- representing the Other and another context
	social and self intertwined
	'intimate habitation' and coperformative witness
abu-lughod
	- the self is always in construction
	- putting self in opposition to the other creates violence and hierarchy
	- feminists and 'halfies' -- upset the singularity of identification


	sameness/difference/groups


	madison
		- local and global
		- must be contextualised
		activism
		acts of activism become performed stores that honour, through intimate habitation and performative witnessing, everyday actts of resistance
		performance activism is powerful because it honours the small stories, the embodied knowledge, the difference.
		difference does not negate the collective

	abu-luhgod
		rejection of a holistic, bounded 'culture'
		3 modes of rejecting culture:
			1. practice and discourse
			2. connections
			3. ethnographies of the particular

post presentation discussion:

	ellie: 'engaging with writing its hard to engage with your affect, whereas performance is a useful way to do so.'

	- improvisation is a useful way (behar) to 


	performance as a 'female thing' and fixed text as a 'male thing' (anthony[in-class])

	tension of knowledge for the sake of itself versus activism (magda asks are these even mutually exclusive?)

	how do we reconcile the activist goals and agendas with the needs of people in a society?


	'utility of performance' (don't remember her name either)

question of textuality in user forums. 

	- megan pointed out that performance tends to pit written text against performance, and that it sets up a dualism that is not helpful. 
		- magda says its important to ask where these writings are coming from. critique of textuality that is academic, and claming to be objective in some way.	then you have abu-luhgod: subjectivity notion in anthropology when you work ethnographically, when there is committments to a kind of ism, you tend to ignore the historical power dynamics of women and men
			- check out "do muslim women need saving?" (abu luhgod)
			- >>> magda says that there is an uneasiness with theory: jargony-filled text, yet we are talking about people's lives, many of whom might not understand what you're even talking about. your participants can't even read the texts you write. the big critique of 'writing culture', while they were all about debunking authoritarian research, but then they go and write this text that is fully academic, who can even read it?? >>> what does it mean to impose your theory??
			- >>> performance is not always about empathy. it can be usurped by colonial powers, right wing governments, they can shut down perspectives, they can be as consertvative as possible. by opposition writing can be very liberating, of course. some scholars refuse to write in very ... but the critique comes from the moment when it wasn't. we should be really careful saying that we are in this very egalitarian equal-ooportunity moment. text is still priviledged for advancement, for career: it doesn't matter if you've organized a symposium, they're going to only count the number of publications you have. this kind of textualism is still operating in ways that aren't fair. madison and conquergood talking about performance as subversive, mockery, it is true, [[see the 'weapon of the weak']] but on the other hand it has set uneasy with magda that people who are subjugated are somehow more embodied. unequitable relations also sustained by academia. the critique comes from a priviledging our assumptions in academia."
				- emma: only thing she would contest is that performance for the sake of empathy is not something we should be striving for because it creates a situation of projection
					- magda, it doesn't always do this. lila abu-luhgod talks about ethnography of the particular. we don't make these grandiose categorizations. context is important. when you do an international aid 
						- emma mentioned dylan robinson's catharsis
							- magda: milione therapeutic nations. if you could only get it together spiritually, etc... abu-luhgod is writing about how particular individuals in this psecific place in time are playing out. ethnography of the particular is against any grandiose generalization. i.e. if we make any claims about performance. >>> how can we make these claims when there are conflicting views on outcome, intent, etc. one performance can be empowering, disempowering, closing doors.  


				jackie:
					- emphasizing the particular plays into neoliberal capitalism. the generalization is written out. by writing out the gernealisation dows not name the capitalistic aspect. [can't remember where she has read this but can't remember]. also pointed out that the word neoliberalism comes up, but not really the grounding of capitalism. the emphasis on the individual is really focusing on this neoliberal capitalism. 
						- >>> magda perhaps more about the research on the individual and therapy and what emma pointed out. the ethnography of the particular is that you name the particular, but you don't generalize the people/ideas. you write from the bottom-up. you cna use theory to think through the various threads, but not going in to a study assuming what you will find.  
							- jackie responded she didn't agree, but the discussion moved on
							
	anthony asked about performative writing
		- megan mentioned a dance theorist who also talks about writing as an embodied performative act (scholar's first name was susan)
		- morgan mentioned that juggling scholars are tending to use youtube for presenting their ideas. 

		ellie: thinking about how we write. also asked what happens when we devalue things that we consider 'fun' as things that are less useful for activism, or communicating 'serious' ideas. 

		theory can be academic work, but can also be useful for problematizing where we want to land (emma)
