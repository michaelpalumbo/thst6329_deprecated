tendency for other scholars in other disciplines to disregard methodologies from anthroplogy: magda mentioned this and said that there is a kind of appropriation process. 

turf-claiming is in this neoliberal academic moment. everything is compared with the scientific, output-driven research, whereas anthropology can't do this, and even theatre and performance studies cant do it either. 

anthropology has become really textual. trend in new materialisms. itts become really in the head, and a criticism is that its been an appropriation of philosophy. 

magda is not saying that interdisciplinarity does not have its merits, but that its very complicated. 

Jackie pointed out that in academia, there isn't only one audience to read (read outside the academy)

clifford: writing culture -- debate on how we use and interpret text, literary focus

gave an image analysis of the book covers [i missed the first one on clifford, but the conquergood was interesting]:
	- conquergood has a facade of a building, and [name of presenter in class] said that when you try to look at something objectively you only see its exterior (possibly she used a different word), and that theatre can help go inside the [object?]


references de certeau
	- points out that that prevailing view was that literature is anything that is not science
	- clifford asks who has the authority to separate science from art?

clifford:
	critique of colonialism
	limits of representation
	science of language itself
		- semiotics and discourse analysis
			- there are a lot of limits on the ways that we discuss a subject
	critique of "visualism"
		- walter j ong: "looking at, objectifying, or reading a given reality" (11)
