what is your positionality? what are the facts you would see for yourself in your ethnographic research project?

what information about you is pertinent in helping your readers situate you within your work?

in situating yourself within your work?

would this information change depeneding on the subject of the ethnographic research?

FOr Carter: recent changes to anthopology are related to changes in the world. cuba doesn't end where land meets sea. 

talks about the challenge of time. 

Ruth Behar 

how does the notion of permission change based on whether you announce yourself as an ethnographer at the outset of a relationship?


do you feel vulnerable?


one are some of the pros and cons of being a member of one's on research commnity? of being an outsider?

"declining rural social class of peasants"

built a monument because the town was going to disappear. 

Alan posited that those who live in urban spaces have a different (or less) of a sense of what community is.

everything that comes from earth is being replaced by cement
everything rural is becoming urban
bread is also being less important than money
fertility is less important than capitalism


is mourning a social or a self-reflexion?
	- do we mourn socially, or just for ourselves?

what unites us?
	- is it important to be united, or is it not?

if capitalism praises who is better than the other, are we going toward or away from community?

has history been more positive when we prosper as a society?

how hard is it to accept that everything you have done will be forgotten or not a part of history.

where is our heart, and where can our memories transport us?

theatre tries to get us to be more human
	- possibly the goal of theatre as something.
	- are we making theatre to fight capitalism
	- or are we getting into capitalism to make something that fights it from within?

is it more important for us to know about art, or to have money in order to buy or do art?

what is happening with our emotions and the way we show them as individuals and as a society?

archive memory
	- based on what you see

distance memory
	- based on the past apart from yourself

duty memory
	- based on the responsibility that you have

holy theatre is based on rituals, and all the things that separate us from earth. 

theatre of cruelty, theatre should be a thing that separates us from other things, separates a person from their life,
